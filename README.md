[00:14.44] Blue-jean baby
[00:17.50] L.A. lady
[00:21.78] Seamstress for the band
[00:27.37] Pretty-eyed
[00:30.82] Pirate smile
[00:34.83] You'll marry a music man
[00:46.83] 
[00:40.83] Ballerina
[00:43.71] You must've seen her
[00:48.39] Dancing in the sand
[00:53.91] And now she's in me
[00:57.43] Always with me
[01:00.77] Tiny dancer in my hand
[01:11.77] 
[01:14.15] Jesus freaks
[01:17.02] Out in the street
[01:20.82] Handing tickets out for God
[01:34.32] 
[01:27.68] Turning back
[01:30.39] She just laughs
[01:33.80] The boulevard is not that bad
[01:48.30] 
[01:40.73] Piano man
[01:43.66] He makes his stand
[01:47.46] In the auditorium
[01:55.96] 
[01:53.99] Looking on
[01:56.92] She sings the songs
[02:00.28] The words she knows
[02:02.08] The tune she hums
[02:10.58] 
[02:13.86] But oh, how it feels so real
[02:16.53] Lying here, with no one near
[02:19.83] Only you and you can hear me
[02:25.15] When I say softly, slowly
[02:37.65] 
[02:34.18] Hold me closer, tiny dancer
[02:40.85] Count the headlights on the highway
[02:47.59] Lay me down in sheets of linen
[02:54.08] You had a busy day today
[03:06.08] 
[03:00.63] Hold me closer, tiny dancer
[03:07.16] Count the headlights on the highway
[03:13.50] Lay me down in sheets of linen
[03:20.37] You had a busy day today
[03:32.37] 
[03:43.78] Blue-jean baby
[03:46.71] L.A. Lady
[03:51.27] Seamstress for the band
[03:57.00] Pretty-eyed
[04:00.35] Pirate smile
[04:04.44] You'll marry a music man
[04:16.44] 
[04:10.55] Ballerina
[04:13.37] You must have seen her
[04:18.17] Dancing in the sand
[04:23.74] Now she's in me
[04:26.67] Always with me
[04:30.18] Tiny dancer in my hand
[04:41.18] 
[04:43.38] Oh, oh, how it feels so real
[04:45.73] Lying here, with no one near
[04:49.13] Only you, and you can hear me
[04:54.38] When I say softly, slowly
[05:06.88] 
[05:03.46] Hold me closer, tiny dancer
[05:09.83] Count the headlights on the highway
[05:16.47] Lay me down in sheets of linen
[05:22.73] You had a busy day today
[05:34.73] 
[05:29.46] Hold me closer, tiny dancer
[05:35.70] Count the headlights on the highway
[05:42.27] Lay me down in sheets of linen
[05:48.53] You had a busy day today
